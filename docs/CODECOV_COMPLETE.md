- [ ] `codecov.yml` exists in root
- [ ] README.md badges updated
- [ ] Git repository has remote URL
- [ ] You have admin access to GitHub repository

Run verification:
```bash
./scripts/verify-codecov-integration.sh
```

---

## Benefits of This Setup

### Automated Coverage Tracking

- ✅ Coverage trends visible over time
- ✅ No manual reporting needed

### Pull Request Integration
- ✅ Automatic PR comments with coverage diff
- ✅ Prevent coverage regression
- ✅ Encourage good testing practices

### Multi-Project Support
- ✅ Separate coverage per API (flags)
- ✅ Track each API independently
- ✅ Set individual targets

### Team Visibility
- ✅ Coverage badges in README
- ✅ Dashboard accessible to all
- ✅ Clear metrics for everyone

### Quality Assurance

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Workflow fails with "CODECOV_TOKEN not found"
**Solution:** Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets (Step 3 above)

#### Issue: Coverage not uploading
**Solution:** Check workflow logs for upload errors. Verify token is correct.

#### Issue: Coverage shows 0%
**Solution:** Verify tests generate `coverage/lcov.info` files. Run `npm run test:cov` locally.

#### Issue: Flags not showing
**Solution:** Ensure workflow has `flags:` parameter for each upload
