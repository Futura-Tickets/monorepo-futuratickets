## Security Measures Implemented

### Smart Contract Security

#### ‚úÖ OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.4.0
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on critical functions
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop mechanism for all operations
- **Ownable**: Access control for admin functions
- **ERC721**: Standard NFT implementation with security best practices
- **ERC2981**: Royalty standard implementation

#### ‚úÖ Access Control
```solidity
// Only owner can mint tickets
function mintNFT(...) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused nonReentrant

// Only token owner can modify their ticket
function setNFTPrice(...) public {
    require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Input Validation
```solidity
// Royalty percentage validation
require(royaltyPercentage <= 100, "Royalty percentage too high");

// Max supply enforcement
require(_tokenIdCounter < maxSupply, "Max supply reached");
```

#### ‚úÖ Safe Math
- Solidity 0.8.25 with built-in overflow/underflow protection
- No unchecked arithmetic operations

#### ‚úÖ Immutable Configuration
```solidity
uint256 public immutable maxSupply;  // Cannot be changed after deployment
```

### Development & Testing

#### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing
- **18+ test cases** covering all functionality
- **Security-specific tests** for attack vectors
- **Gas optimization tests** to detect inefficiencies
- **100% passing rate** on all tests

#### ‚úÖ Continuous Integration
- Automated testing on every commit
- Gas reporter for optimization tracking
- Solidity linter (solhint) for best practices

#### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety in scripts
- Prettier + Solhint for consistent formatting
- Hardhat for professional development environment

## Known Limitations & Risks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Audit Status

**This code has NOT been professionally audited.**

Before mainnet deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Complete internal security review
2. ‚è≥ **Pending**: Professional security audit
3. ‚è≥ **Pending**: Bug bounty program
4. ‚è≥ **Pending**: Formal verification

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Risks

#### 1. Centralization Risk
- **Issue**: Owner has significant control (mint, pause)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Document owner responsibilities
  - Consider multi-sig wallet for owner
  - Implement timelock for critical operations
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Planned

#### 2. Metadata Centralization
- **Issue**: baseURI controlled by owner
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use IPFS for immutable metadata
  - Pin metadata on multiple nodes
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Planned

#### 3. Price Manipulation
- **Issue**: Ticket owners can set arbitrary prices
- **Mitigation**:
  - Already implemented: No restrictions (by design)
  - Market determines fair prices
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted risk

#### 4. Gas Price Variability
- **Issue**: Network congestion can make transactions expensive
- **Mitigation**:
  - Deploy on Base (low fees)
  - Optimize gas usage
  - Consider gasless transactions (EIP-2771)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Partially mitigated

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Promoters (Event Creators)

1. **Secure Your Private Keys**
   - Use hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)
   - Never share private keys
   - Use strong passwords for encrypted keys

2. **Owner Responsibilities**
   - You control who can mint tickets
   - You can pause the contract in emergencies
   - Set appropriate royalty percentages (5-10% recommended)

3. **Metadata Best Practices**
   - Host metadata on IPFS (immutable)
   - Include all ticket details in metadata
   - Ensure baseURI is properly configured

### For Ticket Buyers

1. **Verify Contract Address**
   - Always check contract address on Basescan
   - Verify it matches official documentation
   - Be cautious of fake contracts

2. **Check Token Details**
   - Verify ticket authenticity before purchase
   - Check royalty percentage
   - Verify ticket status (OPEN, CLOSED, SALE)

3. **Resale Market**
   - Set reasonable prices
   - Understand royalties go to original creator
   - Cancel listings when ticket is used

### For Developers (Backend Integration)

1. **Secure RPC Endpoints**
   - Use private RPC nodes when possible
   - Rate limit public endpoints
   - Never expose private keys in code

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Implement proper nonce management
   - Handle failed transactions gracefully
   - Set appropriate gas limits

3. **Event Monitoring**
   - Listen to contract events for state changes
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use EventMonitor library for reliability
